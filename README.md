vector06js Vector-06c Emulator in JavaScript

This is an original emulator of Vector-06c. It is written in JavaScript by hand, it is not a conversion or recompilation of any of previously existing emulators. Presently (2016) it is the only known free/open source software emulator of Vector-06c. It should work fine in Chrome and Firefox on any half decent PC.

Standalone version can take rom, r0m, bin, fdd files drag-n-dropped onto itself: https://svofski.github.io/vector06js/

This emulator is integrated into the Vector06c software archive: https://caglrc.cc/scalar

It also works as a sandbox execution environment for the Pretty i8080 Assembler: https://svofski.github.io/pretty-8080-assembler/ Try pressing RUN.

It uses a fork of 8080-js optimized for performance. Original i8080-js by Alexander Demin: https://github.com/begoon/i8080-js

For zip handling, it relies on zip.js by Gildas Lormeau https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/
